# Webscraping-historical-election-data
It is projected that by 2020, spending on the procurement of datasets is expected to exceed $1 billion USD, either by buying access to the data sets themselves or hiring services to collect data for them. This project attempts to automate a way to gather historical election data for every constituency in Scotland, and represent the historical results for each seat in a separate graph.

This project uses the Wikipedia page for every UK constituency in Scotland to create a pandas dataframe holds the results
of every constituency in every election specified.

In constituencyData.py, the years variable indicates which elections to data back to. It is important that the years are 
formatted accordingly in this way. 

To run the project, use an IDE of your choice and run constituencyData.py, or run constituencyData.py in your command line.
