# Webscraping-historical-election-data
Gathering historical election data for every constituency in Scotland

This project uses the Wikipedia page for every UK constituency in Scotland to create a pandas dataframe holds the results
of every constituency in every election specified.

In constituencyData.py, the years variable indicates which elections to data back to. It is important that the years are 
formatted accordingly in this way. 

To run the project, use an IDE of your choice and run constituencyData.py, or run constituencyData.py in your command line.
