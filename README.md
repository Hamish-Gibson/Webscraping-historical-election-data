# Webscraping-historical-election-data
It is projected that by 2020, spending on the procurement of datasets is expected to exceed $1 billion USD, either by buying access to the data sets themselves or hiring services to collect data for them. This project attempts to automate a way to gather historical election data for every constituency in Scotland and store them in a dataframe.

This project uses the Wikipedia page for every UK constituency in Scotland to create a pandas dataframe that holds the results
of every constituency in every election specified. 

To run the project, use an IDE of your choice and run constituencyData.py, or run constituencyData.py in your command line.
